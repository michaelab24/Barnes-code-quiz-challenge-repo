# Barnes-code-quiz-challenge-repo

Here you have an ugly but functioning quiz. You are given 30 seconds to complete a 5 question quiz conataining questions that pertain to web developement. If you answer a question correctly, you get 2 points. If you answer a question incorrectly, it knocks a point off of your score and decrements the time by 5 seconds. Your score is then displayed once the quiz is over and you can submit your score with your initials.

The only thing I struggled mightily with and spent a lot of hours on was getting a view high scores button and getting said scores to stick around once the page is reloaded. I realize this is just shy of the criteria but I certainly tried my best.
